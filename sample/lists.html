    <h1>There are two types of lists in HTML</h1>
    
    <p>This is an ordered list. It uses numbers to specify 
    the order of the items in the list. OL stands for Ordered List.</p>
    
    <ol>This is the title of the list, if it has one.
      <li>This is the first list item</li>
      <li>This is the second list item</li>
      <li>This is the third list item</li>
      <li>I think that you get the picture...</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>The other type of list is an unordered list. This list 
    has a bullet for each item, indicating that there is no numerical 
    order to the items. UL stands for Unordered List.</p>
    
    <ul>This is the title of the list, if it has one
      <li>This is a list item</li>
      <li>This is also a list item</li>
      <li>This is yet another list item</li>
      <li>Again with the list items</li>
    </ul>
