    <h1>I love pictures!</h1>
    
    <p>The first picture is from an external source. It 
    is retrieved from an external server by referencing the URL.</p>
    
    <img src="http://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/30-impossibly-cute-puppies/impossibly-cute-puppy-2.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" />
    
    <p>This picture however, is my own, and located on the same server 
    that I use for this website. I have created a folder in the same folder 
    that contains this page, called "images" and uploaded my images there. 
    I can then reference that folder and the file in the source of the image.</p>
