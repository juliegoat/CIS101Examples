    <h1>Here we have some paragraphs about this assignment</h1>
    
    <p>This assignment is designed to give us an understanding of 
    each of the HTML elements. This is important so that we can put 
    them together, and create a webpage. Paragraphs are used to break 
    up blocks of text. It can sometimes be difficult to read large 
    blocks of text on a website, and you may lose your viewer's attention.</p>
    
    <p>You'll see that each paragraph will be separate from the last,
    even though they are right next to each other in the code. This makes the
    text on websites more readable. We tend to use paragraphs wherever we 
    have text on our websites that is not a header.</p>
